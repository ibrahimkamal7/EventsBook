# About
EventsBook is created to help people have a break from their busy work schedules and enjoy some quality time with their friends and families. Our app is an “Events” based app where a user can list the events which can be viewed by other users. Other users can view these events along with the relevant information such as the time and location of the event along with the event description. Users can view all the users going to any particular event by clicking on the event. Users can join these events by clicking on the “Join Event” button. After joining the event, users can view the events they are going under the “My Events” tab. After clicking on “My Events” the users can chat with the other users going to that event using the chat interface that we incorporated in our app. Users can view the events around them by clicking on “Map” options in the navigation bar.
